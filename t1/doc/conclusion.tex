\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In summary, the proposed circuit was successful and completely caracterized. Static analysis was performed (the system is not dynamic) both by direct computation using Octave math tool, and according to the mesh analysis method and the node analysis method, and by simulation using the Ngspice tool. All three aproaches agree with very high precision and that was the expected since the analysed circuit was composed only by linear components, there are nether fucntion nor operations propense to provoke numerical instability and there aren't also any component nor disposition of components such that the simple and linear theroretical model used could be out of applicability.

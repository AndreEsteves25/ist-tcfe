\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In summary, the proposed circuit was successful and completely characterized. Static analysis was performed (the system is not dynamic) both by direct computation using the Octave math tool, and according to the mesh analysis method and the node analysis method, and by simulation using the Ngspice tool. All three approaches agree with very high precision and that was the expected since the analyzed circuit was composed only of linear components, there are neither function nor operations prone to cause numerical instability and there arenâ€™t also any component nor disposition of components such that the simple and linear theoretical model used could be out of applicability.

\section{Simulation Analysis}
\label{sec:simulation}

\subsection{Operating Point Analysis}

The circuit under analysis was also simulated using Ngspice (revision 31) and table \ref{tab:op} displays the obtained results. It was used the sign convention and the node (and ground) convention already presented in the theoretical analysis except for the voltage sources where Ngspice own sign convention implies them to have the inverse sign that they would have in our chosen convention. Apart from that, all data obtained by simulation is in fine tune with the theoretical calculations (all deviations are negligible). It is so, because, given the simplicity of the studied circuit there is no possibility of over-approximation or oversimplification of the system by theoretical models, therefore there is no room for deviations between results obtained with different approaches.

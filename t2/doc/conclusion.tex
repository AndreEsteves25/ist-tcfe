\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment, the objective of analyzing an RC circuit (applying the Th√©venin method) has been achieved. Static, time, and frequency analyses have been performed both theoretically using the Octave maths tool and by circuit, simulation using the Ngspice tool. The simulation results matched the theoretical results precisely. 

In summary, the proposed circuit and completely characterized and its analysis successful. Static and dynamic was performed both by direct computation using the Octave math tool, and according to with node analysis method, and by simulation using the Ngspice tool. 

All approaches agree with very high precision and that was expected since the analyzed circuit was composed of components that only established linear interactions between each other.

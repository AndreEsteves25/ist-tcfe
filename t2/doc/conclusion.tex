\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

CONCLUSAO 1: In this laboratory assignment the objective of analysing an RC circuit has been achieved. Static,time and frequency analyses have been performed both theoretically using the Octave maths tool and by circuit simulation using the Ngspice tool. The simulation results matched the theoretical results precisely. The reason for this perfect match is the fact that this is a straightforward circuit containing only linear components, so the theoretical and simulation models cannot differ. For more complex components, the theoretical and simulation models could differ but this is not the case in this work.


CONCLUSAO 2: In summary, the proposed circuit and completely characterized and it's analysis succesful. Static analysis was performed (the system is not dynamic) both by direct computation using the Octave math tool, and according to the mesh analysis method and the node analysis method, and by simulation using the Ngspice tool. All three approaches agree with very high precision and that was the expected since the analyzed circuit was composed only of linear components, there are neither time functions nor operations prone to cause numerical instability and there arenâ€™t also any component nor disposition of components such that the simple and linear theoretical model used could be out of applicability.

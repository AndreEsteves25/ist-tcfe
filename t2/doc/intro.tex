% state the learning objective 
The objective of this laboratory assignment is to study a circuit containing 7 resistors, a linear voltage source $V_a$, a linear current source $I_b$, a current induced voltage source $V_c$ and a voltage induced current source $I_b$. The circuit can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:rc}.

In Section \ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is
presented, accordingly to two distinct methods: mesh analysis and nodal analysis. In Section\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by
simulation, and the results are compared to the theoretical results obtained in
Section~\ref{sec:analysis}. The conclusions of this study are outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.

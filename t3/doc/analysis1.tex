\section{Theoretical Analysis} \label{sec:analysis}

For the envelope detector we used a full bridge (4 ideal diodes) that returns the absolute value of the input voltage. The full bridge was associated with a capacitor ($Ca_1$) and a resistor ($Rb_1$). It was assumed that the capacitor discharges solely through the resistor (the internal resistance of the series of diodes is null).

For the voltage regulator (resistor $R_b1$ in series with 23 diodes -limiter), we used incremental analysis.

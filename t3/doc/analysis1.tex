\section{Theoretical Analysis} \label{sec:analysis}


Octave was also used to obtain the theoretical output values of the envelope detector and the voltage regulator. 



\subsection{Envelope Detector Analysis}

The envelope detector consist of a full wave bridge rectifier and a capacitor, with $1\mu$F.
The rectifier used is the full wave bridge, composed by four diodes. Ideally, this means that the output(vO) is the absolute value of the input (vS) of this rectifier: vO = $|vS|$.

The capacitor was used to smooth the wave in order to make it as close to a line as possible. It was assumed that the capacitor discharges through as series of resistors (composed by the resistor $Rb1$ in series with 25 diodes).

\subsection{Voltage Regulator Analysis}

The voltage regulator consists of a resistor and a limiter (25 diodes in series). This subcircuit takes advantage of the non-linear diode characteristics to attenuate oscillations in the input signal.

We followed the incremental diode model to analise this subcircuit, assuming that the mean output voltage is 12V (confirmed by the ngspice simulation).

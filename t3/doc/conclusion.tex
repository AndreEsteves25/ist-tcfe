\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this laboratory assignment, the objective of build and analyse the working principle of an AC/DC converter was successfully achieved.
In order to analyse the circuit, Octave was used to compute the theoretical values, and Ngspice tool
was used to simulate the circuit.

From tables 2 and 3 we can conclude that despite the value for the deviation was not zero in the simulation, as assumed in theoretical analysis, due to assuming a simplified diode model, a better ripple value was achieved in the simulation analysis. That means that fewer oscillations were observed because the theoretical analysis did not take into account the nonlinear behavior of the diodes, which is responsible for a substantial reduction of oscillations. It also didn't consider that the envelope detector and the voltage regulator don't behave like two separated independent subcircuits and are coupled in a more significant way.

In conclusion, the simulation analysis used a more complete and rigorous method, hence why it's more close to reality. So, due to the high merit value obtained there, we can say that this circuit is good and cheap.

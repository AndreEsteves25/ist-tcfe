\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment, the objective of build and analyse the working principle of an AC/DC converter was successfully achieved.
In order to analyse the circuit, Octave was used to compute the theoretical values and Ngspice tool
was used to simulate the circuit.

With the theoretical values in, the circuit was simulated and the same plot was made, showing
similar results. The input values were then optimised in order to achieve the best simulation output
possible. In conclusion, the simulation result showed less final oscillations than the theoretical one, so we can say that a good circuit was built. I dont know what to say more so...

% state the learning objective 
The objective of this laboratory assignment is to create an AC/DC Converter, a circuit that converts alternate current into direct current, and then, analyse it. This converter is composed by an envelope detector and a voltage regulator.

As seen in Figure \ref{fig:rc}, this circuit can be divided into four parts: \textbf{Voltage Source}, which has an amplitude of 230 V and a frequency of 50 Hz; \textbf{Transformer}, used to transform the supplied voltage into a lower voltage; \textbf{Envelope Detector}, which includes a full-wave bridge rectifier and a capacitor; \textbf{Voltage Regulator}, which consists of a capacitor, a resistor and also a limiter - 25 diodes in series.

% state the learning objective 
The objective of this laboratory assignment is to create a AC/DC Converter, a circuit that converts alternate current into direct current, and then, analyse it. This converter is composed by an envelope detector and a voltage regulator.

In Section \ref{sec:analysis1}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is
presented, following a series of steps. In Section\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by
simulation, and the results are compared to the theoretical results obtained in
Section~\ref{sec:analysis}. The conclusions of this study are outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.

% state the learning objective 
The objective of this laboratory assignment is to create a AC/DC Converter, a circuit that converts alternate current into direct current, and then, analyse it. This converter is composed by an envelope detector and a voltage regulator.

As seen in Figure \ref{fig:rc.pdf}, this circuit can be divided in four parts: \textbf{Voltage Source}, which has an amplitude of 230 V and a frequency of 50 Hz; \textbf{Transformer}, used to transform the supplied voltage into a lower voltage; \textbf{Envelope Detector}, which includes a full wave bridge rectifier and a capacitor ;\textbf{Voltage Regulator}, which consists in a capacitor, a resistor and also a limiter composed by a group of 23 diodes in series.

In Section \ref{sec:analysis1}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is
presented, following a series of steps. In Section\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by
simulation, and the results are compared to the theoretical results obtained in
Section~\ref{sec:analysis}. The conclusions of this study are outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.

% state the learning objective 
The objective of this laboratory assignment is to build an audio amplifier, increasing its gain and bandwidth and minimizing both cost and the value of the lower cutoff frequency. This audio amplifier is composed by gain and output stage.

As seen in Figure \ref{fig:rc}, this circuit has a supply voltage source is $Vcc=12 V$, and can be divided into four parts: \textbf{Input Voltage}, which is an sinusoidal (AC) signal $V_s$, it has a maximum amplitude of $10 mV$ and it's in series with a resistor $R_s=100 \Omega$; \textbf{Gain Stage},composed by a degenerated common emitter amplifier composed by a bias circuit with a bypass capacitor, and an NPN transistor; \textbf{Outuput Stage}, wchich is a common collector amplifier with a PNP transistor; \textbf{Speaker}, which is the load of the circuit with $8 \Omega$.

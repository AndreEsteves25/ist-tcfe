\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this laboratory assignment, the objective of building a Bandpass filter, with central frequency f=1kHz and gain at the central frequency of 40dB, using OP-AMP as shown in Figure \ref{fig:rc} has been achieved.

A merit of \input{../mat/merit.tex} was obtained in the simulation, which is a  value very small comparing with the one obtained in theoretical analysis (). This happens because the value for the central frequency  in the simulation has a bigger deviation, than the theoretical value calculated, which is almost the value desired (1kHz). However, overall the graphics obtained for the theoritical analysis gave us results very similar to the simulation's.

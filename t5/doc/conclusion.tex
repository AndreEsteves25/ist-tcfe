\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this laboratory assignment, the objective of making a Bandpass filter using OP-AMP shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:rc} has been achieved.

A merit of 1.453825e-06 was obtained in the simulation, which is a  value very small comparing with the one obtained in theoritical analysis (). This happens because the value for the central frequency  in the simulation has a bigger deviation, than the theortical value calculated, which is almost the value desired (1kHz). However, overall the graphics obtained for the theoritical analysis gave us results very similar to the simulation's.

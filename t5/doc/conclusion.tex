\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this laboratory assignment, the objective of building a Bandpass filter, with central frequency f=1kHz and gain at the central frequency of 40dB, using OP-AMP as shown in Figure \ref{fig:rc} has been achieved.

A merit of \input{../sim/simmerit.txt} was obtained in the simulation, while the theoretical merit is \input{../mat/merit.tex}. This happens because the value for the gain  in the simulation has a bigger deviation, than the theoretical value calculated, which is almost the value desired (100 linear gain). However, overall the graphics obtained for the theoretical analysis gave us results very similar to the simulation's.

% state the learning objective 
The objective of this laboratory assignment is to build an amplifying circuit based on an OP-AMP component.

As we can see in the figure \ref{fig:rc}, the circuit is composed by a High Pass Filter Stage (C1 and R1), Amplification Stage (R3, R4 and a $\mu$741 OP-AMP as a non-inverting amplifier) and a Low Pass Filter Stage (R2 and C2).

In Section \ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is presented. In Section\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by simulation, and the results are compared to the theoretical results obtained in Section\ref{sec:analysis}. The conclusions of this study are outlined in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.

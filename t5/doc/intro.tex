In Section \ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is presented. In Section\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by simulation, and the results are compared to the theoretical results obtained in Section\ref{sec:analysis}. The conclusions of this study are outlined in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.

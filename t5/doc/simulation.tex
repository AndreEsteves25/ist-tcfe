\section{Simulation Analysis}
\label{sec:simulation}

The circuit under analysis was also simulated using Ngspice (revision 31) and maintaining the already mentioned node convention (figure \ref{fig:rc}). The forward subsections establish a comparison between theoretical and simulation results. The operating point analysis is already discussed in the theoretical anaylisis section and therefore it will not be mentioned again.
